## Abstract

This TIP proposes that TALOS integrate Olympus (OHM) into its treasury as a purpose-built, crypto-native store of value. By holding OHM and leveraging lending markets (Coolers on Ethereum Mainnet, and potentially third-party venues such as Peapod Metavaults on Arbitrum), TALOS can maintain OHM exposure while accessing stablecoin liquidity for operations. This approach strengthens TALOS’ balance sheet with an antifragile, yield-generating asset aligned with its agentic, self-sustaining design.

## Motivation

TALOS’ treasury underpins its autonomy and resilience. A core objective is to hold assets that are:
- Transparent in value.
- Deeply liquid on Arbitrum One.
- Functionally useful for liquidity management.

OHM is uniquely suited:
- As of August 2025, each OHM is backed by $11.73 in reserve assets, providing a transparent and defensible intrinsic value.
- Olympus deploys Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) across chains, including Camelot v3 on Arbitrum, ensuring efficient market depth. Average 30-day trade size on Arbitrum OHM/USDC is $2,517, with <1% slippage.
- OHM’s design purpose is to be a crypto-native store of value — neutral, over-collateralized, and non-sovereign.

TALOS benefits by holding OHM as a strategic treasury reserve, while retaining the option to access liquidity without selling via lending markets.

## Specification

Treasury Allocation:
- TALOS may allocate up to 100% of the stable assets it wishes to hold in reserve into OHM.
- Acquisition via Camelot v3 (Arbitrum) or OTC counterparties to minimize slippage.

Liquidity Access:
- Ethereum: Olympus Coolers provide lending against OHM at 50% LTV, 0.5% interest, with LTV Drip Rate set by:

`max positive rate of change of Origination LTV = 0.0000011574 USDS/second (~0.1 USDS/day)`

Arbitrum: Lending markets could be established via third-party venues such as Peapod Metavaults to extend Cooler-like functionality to TALOS and other Arbitrum-native users.

Reporting:
- TALOS treasury dashboards should incorporate OHM balances and lending activity.

## Rationale
- Resiliency: OHM provides a reserve-backed asset with a stable intrinsic value.
- Liquidity Efficiency: Camelot v3 OHM/USDC pool offers sufficient depth for initial allocations, scalable with Olympus POL.
- Alignment: Both TALOS and Olympus prioritize autonomous treasury design.
- Optionality: Access to liquidity without selling OHM ensures long-term exposure while supporting short-term needs.

## Security Considerations
- Market Risk: OHM may trade above/below its backing. Position sizing and conservative use mitigate this.
- Protocol Risk: TALOS would rely on Olympus contracts (Ethereum) and third-party venues (Arbitrum). Due diligence on external integrations is required.
