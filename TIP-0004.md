## Abstract

This proposal outlines a strategic partnership with Camelot DEX to create liquidity for the Talos ($T) token. We propose migrating the existing Talos liquidity to a dynamic fee concentrated liquidity pool on Camelot. This pool will feature a fee range of 0.3% to 1.5%, allowing for more efficient and profitable liquidity provision. In return, Camelot will provide incentives for liquidity providers, expert guidance on liquidity management, and support to foster the growth of the Talos protocol.

## Motivation

Currently, Talos liquidity is fragmented and not as efficient as it could be. By consolidating a significant portion of our liquidity into a concentrated liquidity pool on a leading DEX like Camelot, we can achieve several key objectives:

*   **Deeper Liquidity:** Concentrated liquidity will result in a deeper market for $T, reducing slippage for traders and creating a more stable price.
*   **Improved Capital Efficiency:** Concentrated liquidity allows liquidity providers to earn more fees with less capital, making it more attractive to provide liquidity for $T.
*   **Dynamic Fees:** A dynamic fee structure will allow the protocol to adapt to market conditions, optimizing fee revenue for liquidity providers and the Talos treasury.
*   **Strategic Partnership:** Partnering with Camelot, a prominent DEX on Arbitrum, will increase visibility for Talos and open up new opportunities for collaboration.

## Specification

1.  **Liquidity Migration:** A portion of the current $T liquidity will be migrated from the existing pool to a new concentrated liquidity pool on Camelot.
2.  **Pool Type:** The new pool will be a concentrated liquidity pool with dynamic fees.
3.  **Fee Range:** The fee for the pool will be dynamically adjusted within a range of 0.3% to 1.5%.
4.  **Camelot's Contribution:**
    *   **Incentives:** Camelot will provide incentives to attract and retain liquidity providers.
    *   **Expertise:** Camelot may offer expertise in managing concentrated liquidity to ensure the pool is managed effectively.
    *   **Support:** Camelot will actively support the Talos protocol and its growth.

## Rationale

*   **Why Camelot?** Camelot is a leading DEX on Arbitrum with a proven track record of innovation and security. The Camelot concentrated liquidity solution is among the most advanced in the market.
*   **Why Concentrated Liquidity?** Concentrated liquidity is the new standard for efficient token swaps. It allows for deeper liquidity with less capital, which is beneficial for both traders and liquidity providers.
*   **Why Dynamic Fees?** The market for $T is constantly evolving. A dynamic fee structure will allow us to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize fee revenue.

## Security Considerations

The primary security consideration is the smart contract risk associated with Camelot's contracts. The Camelot team has a strong reputation for security, and the contracts have been audited by multiple reputable firms.

## Implementation

1.  **Pool Deployment:** Once approved, the Talos team will work with the Camelot team to deploy the new concentrated liquidity pool.
2.  **Liquidity Migration:** The Talos team will manage the migration of liquidity from the existing pools to the new pool.
3.  **Monitoring and Management:** The Talos team, with the guidance of the Camelot team, will monitor and manage the new pool to ensure its success.
